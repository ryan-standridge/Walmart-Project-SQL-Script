# Walmart-Project-SQL-Script
This repository's purpose is to display the SQL script (MySQL) that I used for my Walmart Retail Sales Analysis.

In this script, I explored the Walmart Retail Sales dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vik2012kvs/walmart-dataretail-analysis).

After exploring, I created new tables (names listed in script) in order to further analyze the yearly store sales with holidays.
